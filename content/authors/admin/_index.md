Dr. Baldwin is broadly interested in how large-scale atmospheric dynamics influence regional climate and climatic extremes, with an eye to climate change and policy applications.

Dr. Baldwin is currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.ess.uci.edu/) at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). She was previously a [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/about-ldeo/office-director/postdoctoral-fellowship-earth-environmental-and-ocean-sciences) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) developing models of tropical cyclone risk.
She completed her PhD in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), collaborating with the [NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/).
Her dissertation used Global Climate Models to examine the influence of mountains on deserts, monsoons, and tropical cyclones.
She also researched temporal structure and risk of heat waves through a [PEI-STEP fellowship](https://environment.princeton.edu/education/graduate-certificate-in-environmental-studies/hmei-step-program/) in joint with the [Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (formerly Woodrow Wilson School)](https://spia.princeton.edu/).
She was introduced to climate dynamics research through her senior thesis while an undergraduate studying [Earth and Planetary Science](https://eps.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/).
