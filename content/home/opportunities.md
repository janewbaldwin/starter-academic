## Interested in joining The Climate and Extreme Event Risk Group at UCI?

Our group is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for research and education.  We welcome applicants of any career stage interested in utilizing climatic models and observations to understand dynamics of the climate system, better quantify extreme event risks, and address the critical challenges posed by earth's changing climate.

**Open positions:** <mark>We are currently hiring a postdoc for a NASA-funded project focused on mountains and precipitation patterns in climate models. Please see further info and apply [here](https://recruit.ap.uci.edu/JPF07171)!</mark>

**Prospective postdocs:** If interested in other postdoc opportunities with our group, please email a CV and brief description of interests and background to Dr. Baldwin ([jane.baldwin@uci.edu](mailto:jane.baldwin@uci.edu)). She can also help you apply for competitive UC and national fellowships, including but not limited to the [NOAA Climate and Global Change fellowship](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc), the [L’Oreal USA for Women in Science fellowship](https://www.aaas.org/programs/loreal-usa-women-science), the [UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/), and the [various NSF postdoctoral fellowships](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3).

**Prospective graduate students:** For Fall 2021 admission to the UCI Department of Earth System Science graduate program, applications will be reviewed beginning December 1, and admission offers will be made on a rolling basis. Applicants are encouraged to apply by December 1 for the best chance of admission. The final deadline for applications is March 15. Complete information about the application process can be found [here](https://www.ess.uci.edu/grad). Prospective students interested in working with Dr. Baldwin are encouraged to contact her via email ([jane.baldwin@uci.edu](mailto:jane.baldwin@uci.edu)) prior to the admissions deadline and send a resume/CV, including GPA, and a brief statement describing research interests and background. Prospective graduate students are also strongly encouraged to apply for graduate fellowships, and relevant ones often include the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [NDSEG](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/), [EPA STAR](https://www.epa.gov/research-grants), [NASA FINESST](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/future-investigators-in-nasa-earth-and-space-science-and-technology-finesst/), and [DOE CGSF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/).

**Prospective undergraduate students:** Undergraduate students interested in assisting and leading research related to climate dynamics and impacts are encouraged to directly contact Dr. Baldwin ([jane.baldwin@uci.edu](mailto:jane.baldwin@uci.edu)). Please include a few sentences to one paragraph about your research interests in your email.
