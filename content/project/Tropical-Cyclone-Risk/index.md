Land-falling tropical cyclones are some of the most destructive natural events on Earth. These storms' strong winds, extreme precipitation, surge of seas along coastlines, and flooding cause massive asset losses and impoverishment of vulnerable people. We use a diversity of observations and modeling methods to understand controls on the distribution of tropical cyclones across Earth, and improve projections of their changes with global warming. Additionally, we seek to understand the impacts of tropical cyclones. For example, we currently collaborate with economists at the World Bank to quantify risks from tropical cyclones to wellbeing across income distributions. Ultimately, we seek to develop a holistic understanding of tropical cyclone risk that effectively considers hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and equity.
