abstract: 'Responses of tropical cyclones (TCs) to CO2 doubling are explored using
  coupled global climate models (GCMs) with increasingly refined atmospheric/land
  horizontal grids (~ 200 km, ~ 50 km and ~ 25 km). The three models exhibit similar
  changes in background climate fields thought to regulate TC activity, such as relative
  sea surface temperature (SST), potential intensity, and wind shear. However, global
  TC frequency decreases substantially in the 50 km model, while the 25 km model shows
  no significant change. The ~ 25 km model also has a substantial and spatially-ubiquitous
  increase of Category 3–4–5 hurricanes. Idealized perturbation experiments are performed
  to understand the TC response. Each model’s transient fully-coupled 2 × CO2 TC activity
  response is largely recovered by “time-slice” experiments using time-invariant SST
  perturbations added to each model’s own SST climatology. The TC response to SST
  forcing depends on each model’s background climatological SST biases: removing these
  biases leads to a global TC intensity increase in the ~ 50 km model, and a global
  TC frequency increase in the ~ 25 km model, in response to CO2-induced warming patterns
  and CO2 doubling. Isolated CO2 doubling leads to a significant TC frequency decrease,
  while isolated uniform SST warming leads to a significant global TC frequency increase;
  the ~ 25 km model has a greater tendency for frequency increase. Global TC frequency
  responds to both (1) changes in TC “seeds”, which increase due to warming (more
  so in the ~ 25 km model) and decrease due to higher CO2 concentrations, and (2)
  less efficient development of these“seeds” into TCs, largely due to the nonlinear
  relation between temperature and saturation specific humidity.'
