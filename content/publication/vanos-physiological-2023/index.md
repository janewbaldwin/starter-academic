abstract: Most studies projecting human survivability limits to extreme heat with
  climate change use a 35 °C wet-bulb temperature (Tw) threshold without integrating
  variations in human physiology. This study applies physiological and biophysical
  principles for young and older adults, in sun or shade, to improve current estimates
  of survivability and introduce liveability (maximum safe, sustained activity) under
  current and future climates. Our physiology-based survival limits show a vast underestimation
  of risks by the 35 °C Tw model in hot-dry conditions. Updated survivability limits
  correspond to Tw~25.8–34.1 °C (young) and ~21.9–33.7 °C (old)—0.9–13.1 °C lower
  than Tw = 35 °C. For older female adults, estimates are ~7.2–13.1 °C lower than
  35 °C in dry conditions. Liveability declines with sun exposure and humidity, yet
  most dramatically with age (2.5–3.0 METs lower for older adults). Reductions in
  safe activity for younger and older adults between the present and future indicate
  a stronger impact from aging than warming.
