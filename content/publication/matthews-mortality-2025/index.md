abstract: Extreme heat threatens human life, evidenced by textgreater260,000 heat-related
  fatalities collectively in the deadliest events since 2000. In this Review, we link
  physical climate science with heat mortality risk, including crossings of uncompensable
  thresholds (beyond which human core body temperature rises uncontrollably) and unsurvivable
  thresholds (lethal core temperature increase within 6 h). Uncompensable thresholds
  (wet-bulb temperatures ~19–32 °C) depend strongly on age and the combination of
  air temperature and relative humidity. These thresholds have been breached rarely
  for younger adults (~2.2% of land area over 1994–2023) but more widely for older
  adults (~21%). Unsurvivable thresholds (wet-bulb temperatures ~20–34 °C) were only
  exceeded for older adults (~1.8% of land area). Anthropogenic warming will lead
  to more frequent threshold crossings, including tripling of the uncompensable land
  area for young adults if warming reaches 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Interdisciplinary
  work must improve the understanding of the deadly potential of unprecedented heat
  and how it can be reduced. Ensuring reliable access for all to cool refugia is an
  urgent priority as the atmosphere threatens to increasingly overwhelm human physiology
  under climate warming.
