abstract: The temporal structure of heat waves having substantial human impact varies
  widely, with many featuring a compound structure of hot days interspersed with cooler
  breaks. In contrast, many heat wave definitions employed by meteorologists include
  a continuous threshold-exceedance duration criterion. This study examines the hazard
  of these diverse sequences of extreme heat in the present, and their change with
  global warming. We define compound heat waves to include those periods with additional
  hot days following short breaks in heat wave duration. We apply these definitions
  to analyze daily temperature data from observations, NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
  Laboratory global climate model simulations of the past and projected climate, and
  synthetically generated time series. We demonstrate that compound heat waves will
  constitute a greater proportion of heat wave hazard as the climate warms and suggest
  an explanation for this phenomenon. This result implies that in order to limit heat-related
  mortality and morbidity with global warming, there is a need to consider added vulnerability
  caused by the compounding of heat waves.
