abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) risk assessments are critical for disaster preparedness
  and response. Alongside hazard and exposure, accurate TC risk assessment requires
  understanding the vulnerability of populations and assets. In this chapter, we examine
  multiple methods that have been used to assess and quantify TC vulnerability with
  a focus on open-source methods. We separately discuss structural, economic, and
  social (or demographic) vulnerability approaches. Structural vulnerability assesses
  the susceptibility of buildings to be affected by their exposure to hazards; in
  this section, we provide a detailed overview of how FEMAâ€™s Hazus model quantifies
  damages by utilizing engineering principles. Economic vulnerability employs regression
  analysis to relate wind speeds to damages; this discussion explores typical functional
  forms used to represent vulnerability in such analysis and efforts to constrain
  parameters in these functions. Finally, social approaches use demographic data to
  characterize the varying susceptibility of populations to TC risk; we provide some
  representative examples of this methodology. We conclude with a comparative discussion
  of these three classes of methods, suggest directions for future work, and ask whether
  the different approaches can be combined to yield a more holistic view of both the
  human and structural aspects of TC vulnerability.
