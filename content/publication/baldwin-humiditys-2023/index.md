abstract: 'Background:  As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise,
  temperature and humidity will increase further, causing potentially dire increases
  in human heat stress. On physiological and biophysical grounds, exposure to higher
  levels of humidity should worsen heat stress by decreasing sweat evaporation. However,
  population-scale epidemiological studies of heat exposure and response often do
  not detect associations between high levels of humidity and heat-related mortality
  or morbidity. These divergent, disciplinary views regarding the role of humidity
  in heat-related health risks limit confidence in selecting which interventions are
  effective in reducing health impacts and in projecting future heat-related health
  risks.  Objectives:  Via our multidisciplinary perspective we seek to a) reconcile
  the competing realities concerning the role of humidity in heat-related health impacts
  and b) help ensure robust projections of heat-related health risks with climate
  change. These objectives are critical pathways to identify and communicate effective
  approaches to cope with present and future heat challenges.  Discussion:  We hypothesize
  six key reasons epidemiological studies have found little impact of humidity on
  heatâ€“health outcomes: a) At high temperatures, there may be limited influence of
  humidity on the health conditions that cause most heat-related deaths (i.e., cardiovascular
  collapse); b) epidemiological data sets have limited spatial extent, a bias toward
  extratropical (i.e., cooler and less humid), high-income nations, and tend to exist
  in places where temporal variations in temperature and humidity are positively correlated;
  c) analyses focus on older, vulnerable populations with sweating, and thus evaporative,
  impairments that may be further aggravated by dehydration; d) extremely high levels
  of temperature and humidity (seldom seen in the historical record) are necessary
  for humidity to substantially impact heat strain of sedentary individuals; e) relationships
  between temperature and humidity are improperly considered when interpreting epidemiological
  model results; and f) sub-daily meteorological phenomena, such as rain, occur at
  high temperatures and humidity, and may bias epidemiological studies based on daily
  data. Future research must robustly test these hypotheses to advance methods for
  more accurate incorporation of humidity in estimating heat-related health outcomes
  under present and projected future climates. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11807'
