abstract: Extreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves, cyclones, and floods,
  are an expression of climate variability. These events and events influenced by
  climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity
  and mortality, and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse
  health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change
  and more people moving into harm’s’ way could alter this trend. Long-term changes
  to Earth’s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme
  events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate
  under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot
  be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building
  climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response,
  and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and developing
  health system adaptation plans, can identify priority actions to effectively reduce
  risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks
  are urgent, so action is needed now.
