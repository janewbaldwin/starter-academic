abstract: Abstract Heat waves (HWs) are among the most damaging climate extremes to
  human society. Climate models consistently project that HW frequency, severity,
  and duration will increase markedly over this century. For urban residents, the
  urban heat island (UHI) effect further exacerbates the heat stress resulting from
  HWs. Here we use a climate model to investigate the interactions between the UHI
  and HWs in 50 cities in the United States under current climate and future warming
  scenarios. We examine UHI2m (defined as urban-rural difference in 2m-height air
  temperature) and UHIs (defined as urban-rural difference in radiative surface temperature).
  Our results show significant sensitivity of the interaction between UHI and HWs
  to local background climate and warming scenarios. Sensitivity also differs between
  daytime and nighttime. During daytime, cities in the temperate climate region show
  significant synergistic effects between UHI and HWs in current climate, with an
  average of 0.4 K higher UHI2m or 2.8 K higher UHIs during HWs than during normal
  days. These synergistic effects, however, diminish in future warmer climates. In
  contrast, the daytime synergistic effects for cities in dry regions are insignificant
  in the current climate, but emerge in future climates. At night, the synergistic
  effects are similar across climate regions in the current climate, and are stronger
  in future climate scenarios. We use a biophysical factorization method to disentangle
  the mechanisms behind the interactions between UHI and HWs that explain the spatial-temporal
  patterns of the interactions. Results show that the difference in the increase of
  urban versus rural evaporation and enhanced anthropogenic heat emissions (air conditioning
  energy use) during HWs are key contributors to the synergistic effects during daytime.
  The contrast in water availability between urban and rural land plays an important
  role in determining the contribution of evaporation. At night, the enhanced release
  of stored and anthropogenic heat during HWs are the primary contributors to the
  synergistic effects.
