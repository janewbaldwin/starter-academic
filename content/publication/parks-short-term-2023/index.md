abstract: 'Knowledge of excess deaths after tropical cyclones is critical to understanding
  their impacts, directly relevant to policies on preparedness and mitigation. We
  applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models to 40.7 million U.S. deaths and a comprehensive
  record of 179 tropical cyclones over 32 years (1988–2019) to estimate short-term
  all-cause excess deaths. The deadliest tropical cyclone was Hurricane Katrina in
  2005, with 1491 [95% credible interval (CrI): 563, 3206] excess deaths (textgreater99%
  posterior probability of excess deaths), including 719 [95% CrI: 685, 752] in Orleans
  Parish, LA (textgreater99% probability). Where posterior probabilities of excess
  deaths were textgreater95%, there were 3112 [95% CrI: 2451, 3699] total post–hurricane
  force excess deaths and 15,590 [95% CrI: 12,084, 18,835] post–gale to violent storm
  force deaths; 83.1% of post–hurricane force and 70.0% of post–gale to violent storm
  force excess deaths occurred more recently (2004–2019); and 6.2% were in least socially
  vulnerable counties.'
