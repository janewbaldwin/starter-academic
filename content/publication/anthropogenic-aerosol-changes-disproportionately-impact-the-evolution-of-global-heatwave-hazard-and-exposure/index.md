title: Anthropogenic aerosol changes disproportionately impact the evolution of
  global heatwave hazard and exposure
abstract: Understanding and predicting heatwave risk is a societal imperative in
  the face of climate change. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions impact heat
  extremes more strongly per unit of mean warming than do greenhouse gases, but
  the influence of aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern on time-varying heatwave
  hazard and resulting population exposure has been largely ignored. Aerosols’
  spatially heterogeneous forcing is often co-located with population centers
  due to aerosols’ industrial sources and short atmospheric lifetime,
  potentially resulting in amplified exposure to aerosol-driven climate effects.
  Here, we quantify the influence of historical and projected future changes in
  aerosol emissions through 2100 on global patterns of heatwave hazard (i.e. the
  frequency of heatwave days) and exposure (i.e. population-weighted hazard)
  using the NCAR Community Earth System Model v1 single forcing large ensemble
  (LE). Our results show that increased aerosol emissions since 1920 have
  suppressed heatwave frequency (HWF) over populated regions by roughly half
  through present-day—a trend that is now reversing with shifting emission
  patterns and net global declining emissions. This may already be leading to an
  aerosol-driven acceleration in HWF, a signal that is amplified in populated
  regions. Aerosols’ influence on heatwaves is strongly co-located with
  population, creating out-sized exposure, which evolves through time with
  aerosols’ evolving emissions pattern within this LE. Our results suggest that
  near-term changes in aerosol emissions will be a disproportionate driver of
  trends in heatwave exposure, meriting dedicated future study, and that
  aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern should be considered in attempts to
  attribute recent heatwave trends to human activity.
