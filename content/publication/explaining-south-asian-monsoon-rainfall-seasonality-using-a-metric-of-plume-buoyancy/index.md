title: Explaining South Asian Monsoon Rainfall Seasonality Using a Metric of
  Plume Buoyancy
abstract: >
  Localized tropical rainfall changes commonly occur on 500-1,000 km scales
  under various climate forcings, but understanding

  their causality remains challenging. One helpful process-oriented diagnostic (POD) decomposes the effects of undilute buoyancy

  and lower free-tropospheric moisture through a precipitation-buoyancy relationship, but its applicability at subregional scales

  is uncertain. We examine month-to-month rainfall changes in five South Asian monsoon subregions. The POD accurately

  characterizes the precipitation-buoyancy relationship across all subregions and months, successfully predicting the sign of monthto-month rainfall changes in four out of five subregions. However, the PODâ€™s ability to predict rainfall change magnitudes and

  identify causal mechanisms varies considerably, providing confident explanations in only one subregion (central India), where

  lower free-tropospheric moisture, and increased sensitivity to this moisture, dominates changes. These findings highlight the

  limitations of the POD, and we caution against using the POD as a standalone tool at these scales for predicting rainfall changes

  or decomposing their drivers.
