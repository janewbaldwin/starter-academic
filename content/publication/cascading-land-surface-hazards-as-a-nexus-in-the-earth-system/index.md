title: Cascading land surface hazards as a nexus in the Earth system
abstract: Earth’s surface is sculpted by numerous processes that move sediment,
  ranging from gradual and benign to abrupt and catastrophic. Although
  infrequent, high-magnitude sediment mobilization events can be hazardous to
  people and infrastructure, leaving topographic imprints on the landscape and
  remarkable narratives in the historical record. Hazardous events such as
  fires, storms, and earthquakes accelerate erosion and sediment transport,
  increasing landscape sensitivity to subsequent perturbations, thus forming a
  cascading hazard. Although the redistribution of sediment across Earth’s
  landscape can result in higher risks to vulnerable populations, cascading
  processes are commonly unaccounted for in hazard assessments. Cascading
  hazards can occur almost immediately after triggering events, such as
  coseismic landslides, or over months, years, or even decades after an initial
  perturbation, such as debris flows after wildfires or flooding in channels
  alluviated by volcanic debris. Sediment cascades span Earth’s surface, from
  mountaintops to river valleys, where erosion, deposition, and aggradation can
  lead to a myriad of hazardous processes, including decreased river conveyance
  capacity, which increases the likelihood of downstream flooding. An improved
  understanding of the magnitude, frequency, and persistence of cascading
  hazards is critical given the rapid changes in the frequency and severity of
  storms, fires, sea-level change, and cryospheric melting, as well as the
  expansion of high-population-density urban footprints in regions susceptible
  to solid Earth hazards. Understanding the full consequences and underlying
  physics of Earth’s cascading land surface hazards can help minimize future
  human and economic losses.
