title: non-survivable heat stress conditions are already occurring
abstract: The heat stress limits for human survivability have been long defined
  by a 6-h exposure to a wet-bulb temperature of 35oC. This definition has been
  employed regularly by the climate community to understand the threat of heat
  stress on humans. However, we recently developed a physiology-based model
  demonstrating that environmental heat stress thresholds, when accounting for
  limitations to evaporative cooling via sweating, and realistic hyperthermic
  thresholds for heat stroke, may be cooler and drier than previously thought.
  The potential consequences for older people, in whom sweating responses are
  further diminished, are thought to be especially severe. For the first time,
  we employ our physiology-based heat stress limit model to determine whether
  non-survivable thresholds (defined by temperature and humidity) were surpassed
  during six historical events where conditions were climatologically extreme
  and/or high heat-related mortality was reported. We focus on six-hourly
  environmental limits for two age groups that are either completely exposed or
  have sought shade. Our results show that non-survivable limits are already
  occurring during present-day extreme heat events, all of which are well below
  the theorised 35oC wet-bulb temperature threshold. Of particular concern is
  the regular exceedance of deadly thresholds for older people outdoors across
  all events. Moreover, extremely hot yet dry conditions are just as deadly as
  hot and humid conditions, despite much lower wet-bulb temperatures than 35oC.
  For future climatological assessments, we emphasise the importance of
  employing physiology-derived methods to accurately assess the risk of
  potentially deadly heat stress.
