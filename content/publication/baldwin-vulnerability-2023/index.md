abstract: Abstract The authors describe a tropical cyclone risk model for the Philippines
  using open-source methods that can be straightforwardly generalized to other countries.
  Wind fields derived from historical observations, as well as those from an environmentally
  forced tropical cyclone hazard model, are combined with data representing exposed
  value and vulnerability to determine asset losses. Exposed value is represented
  by the LitPop dataset, which assumes total asset value is distributed across a country
  following population density and night-lights data. Vulnerability is assumed to
  follow a functional form previously proposed by Emanuel, with free parameters chosen
  by a sensitivity analysis in which simulated and historical reported damages are
  compared for different parameter values and further constrained by information from
  household surveys about regional building characteristics. Use of different vulnerability
  parameters for the region around Manila, Philippines, yields much better agreement
  between simulated and actually reported losses than does a single set of parameters
  for the entire country. Despite the improvements from regionally refined vulnerability,
  the model predicts no losses for a substantial number of destructive historical
  storms, a difference the authors hypothesize is due to the use of wind speed as
  the sole metric of tropical cyclone hazard, omitting explicit representation of
  storm surge and/or rainfall. Bearing these limitations in mind, this model can be
  used to estimate return levels for tropical cycloneâ€“caused wind hazards and asset
  losses for regions across the Philippines, relevant to some disaster risk reduction
  and management tasks; this model also provides a platform for further development
  of open-source tropical cyclone risk modeling. Significance Statement Landfalling
  tropical cyclones are devastating disasters for which the Philippines is particularly
  at risk. Here we develop a model for tropical cyclone risk, quantified as property
  losses, over the Philippines and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing to historical
  damages. We find that capturing the difference in vulnerability between the largest
  city in the Philippines (Manila) and more rural areas is important to accurately
  represent this risk. Using this model, we can more accurately constrain the risk
  of very extreme tropical cyclone events in the Philippines. The model can also be
  straightforwardly adapted for emergency planning in other countries and for climate
  change scenarios using openly available information.
