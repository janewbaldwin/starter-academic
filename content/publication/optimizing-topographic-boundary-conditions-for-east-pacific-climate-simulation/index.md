title: Optimizing Topographic Boundary Conditions for East Pacific Climate Simulation
abstract: Overly smooth topography in general circulation models (GCMs)
  underestimates the blocking effect of the steep mountain ranges flanking the
  eastern Pacific. We explore the impact of this bias on common biases in
  Pacific climate simulation [i.e., the unrealistic cross-equatorial symmetry of
  near-surface winds, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and precipitation]
  through sensitivity experiments with modified Central and/or South American
  topography in an atmosphereâ€“ocean coupled GCM. Quantifying orographic blocking
  potential via the Froude number, we determine that an envelope topographic
  interpolation scheme best captures observed blocking patterns. Implementing
  envelope topography only in Central America reduced model biases as greater
  blocking of the trade winds warmed SST and enhanced convergence in the
  northeastern Pacific. Doing so additionally over the Andes improved the
  simulation of South Pacific circulation and the South Pacific convergence zone
  as stronger deflection of the westerlies intensified the South Pacific
  anticyclone. This mitigated convection biases in the southeast Pacific by
  increasing subsidence and cooling SST. However, remote impacts of the Andes
  exacerbated the dry bias in the northeast tropical Pacific, resulting in
  negligible improvement in the East Pacific double-ITCZ. We find that, due to
  the significant role of large-scale convergence in driving precipitation
  patterns, other model biases, such as cloud-radiative biases, may modulate the
  impact of altering topography. Our results highlight the importance of
  considering alternate methods for calculating model topographic boundary
  conditions, though the optimal interpolation scheme will vary with model
  resolution and the impact of topography on GCM biases can be sensitive to
  choices made in formulating parameterizations.
