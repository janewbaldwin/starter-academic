title: Increasing risk of heat stress at the Summer Olympics
abstract: Rising temperatures under climate change threaten athlete safety at
  the Summer Olympics due to increasing heat stress likelihoods. For outdoor
  sports, suspending activity (i.e. rescheduling or cancelling) is the only
  possible intervention for mitigating heat stress risk in excessively hot or
  humid conditions, presenting logistical challenges to organizers. We evaluate
  the event suspension probability of outdoor Summer Olympic sports in past and
  potential future host cities due to unsafe climatic conditions for the recent
  past (1983â€“2016) and future projected in 2050. Assuming that >50% event
  suspension probability is logistically prohibitive, the number of viable host
  cities decreases from 709 to 595 (16%) in 2050. Remaining viable hosts are
  more affluent, located at higher elevations and latitudes, or in the Southern
  Hemisphere. Our results highlight growing heat-related risks at athletic
  events and can inform planning and adaptation priorities for future Summer
  Olympics.
