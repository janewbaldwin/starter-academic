abstract: Extreme heat is a recognized threat to human health. This study examines
  projected future trends of multiple measures of extreme heat across Texas throughout
  the next century, and evaluates the expected climate changes alongside Texas athletic
  staff (coach and athletic trainer) attitudes toward heat and climate change. Numerical
  climate simulations from the recently published Community Earth System Model version
  2 and the Climate Model Intercomparison Project were used to predict changes in
  summer temperatures, heat indices, and wet bulb temperatures across Texas and also
  within specific metropolitan areas. A survey examining attitudes toward the effects
  of climate change on athletic programs and student athlete health was also distributed
  to high-school and university athletic staff. Heat indices are projected to increase
  beyond what is considered healthy/safe limits for outdoor sports activity by the
  mid-to-late 21st century. Survey results reveal a general understanding and acceptance
  of climate change and a need for adjustments in accordance with more dangerous heat-related
  events. However, a portion of athletic staff still do not acknowledge the changing
  climate and its implications for student athlete health and their athletic programs.
  Enhancing climate change and health communication across the state may initiate
  important changes to athletic programs (e.g., timing, duration, intensity, and location
  of practices), which should be made in accordance with increasingly dangerous temperatures
  and weather conditions. This work employs a novel interdisciplinary approach to
  evaluate future heat projections alongside attitudes from athletic communities toward
  climate change.
