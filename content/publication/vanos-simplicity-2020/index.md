abstract: Extreme heat adversely affects human health, productivity, and well-being,
  with more frequent and intense heatwaves projected to increase exposures. However,
  current risk projections oversimplify critical inter-individual factors of human
  thermoregulation, resulting in unreliable and unrealistic estimates of future adverse
  health outcomes.
