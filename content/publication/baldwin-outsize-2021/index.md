abstract: "Global Climate Models (GCMs) exhibit substantial biases in their simulation\
  \ of tropical climate. One particularly problematic bias exists in GCMs' simulation\
  \ of the tropical rainband known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Much\
  \ of the precipitation on Earth falls within the ITCZ, which plays a key role in\
  \ setting Earth's temperature by affecting global energy transports, and partially\
  \ dictates dynamics of the largest interannual mode of climate variability: The\
  \ El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Most GCMs fail to simulate the mean state\
  \ of the ITCZ correctly, often exhibiting a “double ITCZ bias,” with rainbands both\
  \ north and south rather than just north of the equator. These tropical mean state\
  \ biases limit confidence in climate models' simulation of projected future and\
  \ paleoclimate states, and reduce the utility of these models for understanding\
  \ present climate dynamics. Adjusting GCM parameterizations of cloud processes and\
  \ atmospheric convection can reduce tropical biases, as can artificially correcting\
  \ sea surface temperatures through modifications to air-sea fluxes (i.e., “flux\
  \ adjustment”). Here, we argue that a significant portion of these rainfall and\
  \ circulation biases are rooted in orographic height being biased low due to assumptions\
  \ made in fitting observed orography onto GCM grids. We demonstrate that making\
  \ different, and physically defensible, assumptions that raise the orographic height\
  \ significantly improves model simulation of climatological features such as the\
  \ ITCZ and North American rainfall as well as the simulation of ENSO. These findings\
  \ suggest a simple, physically based, and computationally inexpensive method that\
  \ can improve climate models and projections of future climate."
