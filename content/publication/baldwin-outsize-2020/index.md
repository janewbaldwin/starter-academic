abstract: "Global Climate Models (GCMs) exhibit substantial biases in their simulation\
  \ of  tropical climate. One particularly problematic bias exists in GCMs' simulation\
  \ of the tropical rainband known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Much\
  \ of the precipitation on Earth falls within the ITCZ, which plays a key role in\
  \ setting Earth's temperature by affecting global energy transports, and partially\
  \ dictates dynamics of the largest interannual mode of climate variability: the\
  \ El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Most GCMs fail to simulate the mean state\
  \ of the ITCZ correctly, often exhibiting a \\\"double ITCZ bias\\\", with rainbands\
  \ both north and south rather than just north of the equator. These tropical mean\
  \ state biases limit confidence in climate models' simulation of projected future\
  \ and paleoclimate states, and reduce the utility of these models for understanding\
  \ present climate dynamics. Adjusting GCM parameterizations of cloud processes and\
  \ atmospheric convection can reduce tropical biases, as can artificially correcting\
  \ sea surface temperatures (SSTs) through modifications to air-sea fluxes (i.e.\
  \ \\\"flux adjustment\\\"). Here we argue that a significant portion of these rainfall\
  \ and circulation biases are rooted in orographic height being biased low due to\
  \ assumptions made in fitting observed orography onto GCM grids. We demonstrate\
  \ that making different, and physically defensible, assumptions that raise the orographic\
  \ height significantly improves model simulation of climatological features such\
  \ as the ITCZ and North American rainfall as well as the simulation of ENSO. These\
  \ findings suggest a simple, physically-based, and computationally inexpensive method\
  \ that can improve climate models and projections of future climate."
