 abstract = {Extreme heat adversely affects human health, productivity, and well-being, with more frequent
and intense heatwaves projected to increase exposures. However, current risk projections oversimplify
critical inter-individual factors of human thermoregulation, resulting in unreliable and unrealistic
estimates of future adverse health outcomes.},
