  impact of large-scale orography on wintertime near-surface (850 hPa) temperature
  variability on daily and synoptic time scales (from days to weeks) in the Northern
  Hemisphere is investigated. Using a combination of theory, idealized modeling work,
  and simulations with a comprehensive climate model, it is shown that large-scale
  orography reduces upstream temperature gradients, in turn reducing upstream temperature
  variability, and enhances downstream temperature gradients, enhancing downstream
  temperature variability. Hence, the presence of the Rockies on the western edge
  of the North American continent increases temperature gradients over North America
  and, consequently, increases North American temperature variability. By contrast,
  the presence of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas on the eastern edge of the
  Eurasian continent damps temperature variability over most of Eurasia. However,
  Tibet and the Himalayas also interfere with the downstream development of storms
  in the North Pacific storm track, and thus damp temperature variability over North
  America, by approximately as much as the Rockies enhance it. Large-scale orography
  is also shown to impact the skewness of downstream temperature distributions, as
  temperatures to the north of the enhanced temperature gradients are more positively
  skewed while temperatures to the south are more negatively skewed. This effect is
  most clearly seen in the northwest Pacific, off the east coast of Japan.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectiontextgreater
