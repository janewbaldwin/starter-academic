abstract: 'Arid extratropical Asia (AEA) is bisected at the wetter Tian Shan (a northern
  offshoot of the Tibetan Plateau) into east and west deserts, each with unique climatological
  characteristics. The east deserts (~35°–55°N, ~75°–115°E) have a summer precipitation
  maximum, and the west deserts (~35°–55°N, ~45°–75°E) have a winter–spring precipitation
  maximum. A new high-resolution (50 km atmosphere–land) global coupled climate model
  is run with the Tian Shan removed to determine whether these mountains are responsible
  for the climatological east–west differentiation of AEA. Multicentennial simulations
  for the Control and NoTianshan runs highlight statistically significant effects
  of the Tian Shan. Overall, the Tian Shan are found to enhance the precipitation
  seasonality gradient across AEA, mostly through altering the east deserts. The Tian
  Shan dramatically change the precipitation seasonality of the Taklimakan Desert
  directly to its east (the driest part of AEA) by blocking west winter precipitation,
  enhancing subsidence over this region, and increasing east summer precipitation.
  The Tian Shan increase east summer precipitation through two mechanisms: 1) orographic
  precipitation, which is greatest on the eastern edge of the Tian Shan in summer,
  and 2) remote enhancement of the East Asian summer monsoon through alteration of
  the larger-scale seasonal mean atmospheric circulation. The decrease in east winter
  precipitation also generates remote warming of the Altai and Kunlun Shan, mountains
  northeast and southeast of the Tian Shan, respectively, due to reduction of snow
  cover and corresponding albedo decrease.'
